# Webhooks
## What are webhooks used for?
If you are looking for an easy way to run some code when an event happens then webhooks are the right tool. They allow you to give us a URL that we will trigger on certain events.

## Setting up a webhook
You can find webhooks in the <a href="https://dashboard.lancero.app/developers">developer settings</a>. From there you can navigate to the webhooks menu and create a new webhook.

In the webhook creator you need to specify at least two things.
- URL, the URL where we will send a POST-request.
- Events, toggle the events you want to receive.

## Receiving events
When an event is triggered we send a POST-request to the URL you specified. In the request body we will put one variable called `event`.
You can exchange this variable for the event-data using your secret key. This can either be done through the <a href="/node/methods/webhooks">Node.js library</a> or an <a href="/public-api/endpoints/webhooks">API-call</a>.
