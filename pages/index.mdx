# Lancero

A big part of Lancero is to provide ease-of-use and customisability. We provide this through our easily accessible API and various libraries and plug-ins.
We want Lancero to integrate seamlessly in your project. Below you can find a flowchart of an example integration, this is how we envisioned Lancero but don't worry any integration is fine as long as it suits your needs!
