# Public API
If you don't want to use any of the provided libraries or none are available, we also offer you the ability to manually call the API.

## Authentication
To authenticate your request you will have to pass your project's API key as a bearer token.
If no correct token is passed, your request will respond with a `401, Incorrect Bearer token specified`.
