# Claims
## POST `/claims/exchange`
This route is used to exchange your Lancero token for lead and code data.
Everytime someone claims a code using the no-code Lancero Portal we send them to the redirect URL you specified in your <a href={'https://dashboard.lancero.app/settings/project'}>project settings</a> and append the `lancero_token` query parameter. This token is valid for 60 seconds and can be exchanged for the data of both lead and code using your secret key.

### Request body
- code: The code that you want to claim
- email: The email of the customer that wants to claim this code
